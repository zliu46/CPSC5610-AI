Course Description:

Artificial Intelligence is considered as one of the most dynamic fields in computer science and engineering with various applications, active research domains, and wide range of tools and problems. In this course students will understand what AI is, learn the concepts and techniques of AI, with an emphasis on building intelligent agents, environments and systems, and explore use cases and applications of AI. Students will also learn methods and tools for building AI systems for various applications and demonstrate AI in action with projects. 

Pre-requisite:

Students are expected to have the following background:    

    Familiarity with computer science principles and object-oriented programming (CPSC 5011 Object-Oriented Concepts)
    Familiarity with algorithms (CPSC 5031 Algorithms)
    Knowledge of probability theory and statistics such as Bayes theorem.
    Knowledge of programming skills, at a level sucient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program in Python.

Learning Objectives:

On successful completion of this course (i.e. by passing this course), you will be able to

    Demonstrate understanding of basic artificial intelligence approaches to problem solving.
    Use algorithms and appropriate representation techniques for solving problems requiring learning and reasoning.
    Design and implement programs using common programming languages and tools used to construct intelligent artifacts.
